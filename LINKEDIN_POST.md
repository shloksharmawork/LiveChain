# 🚀 Just Shipped: LiveChain - Real-Time Blockchain Analytics Dashboard

I built **LiveChain** to visualize Ethereum Mainnet activity in real-time, focusing on performance and premium UI design.

🔗 **Tech Stack:**
*   **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19
*   **Styling:** TailwindCSS v4 with Glassmorphism architecture
*   **Web3 Integration:** Wagmi + Viem + RainbowKit
*   **Data Stream:** Alchemy WebSockets (WSS)

⚡ **Key Features:**
*   **Live Block Feed:** Zero-latency streaming of new blocks.
*   **Whale Detector 🐋:** Real-time listeners for transactions >10 ETH.
*   **Gas Tracker:** Dynamic Gwei monitoring with polling.
*   **Optimized:** Custom `useBlockchainStream` hooks for efficient resource management.

This project demonstrates how to handle high-frequency data streams efficiently in a React application while maintaining a smooth, 60fps experience.

I'm currently looking for full-stack / frontend roles with US-based startups and founders building the future of Web3. If you need robust, user-centric dashboards, let's chat!
